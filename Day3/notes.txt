creating our first server using http


 1. Creating Your First Server with HTTP in Node.js
Core Concept: Node.js allows you to create web servers using its built-in http module. This module provides the tools to listen for incoming requests and send responses back to clients (like web browsers).

 Example Code:
 const http = require('http');
 const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
 res.statusCode = 200;
 res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
 res.end('Hello, World!\\n');
 });
 const port = 3000;
 server.listen(port, () => {
 console.log(`Server running at <http://localhost>:${po
 rt}/`);
 });


 2. What are Request and Response

Request (req):
 Definition: The request is the message sent from a client (usually a web browser or another application) to the server. It's the "ask" part of the conversation.

 component: URL, Headers and Body

Response (res):
 Definition: The response is the message sent back from the server to the client as a result of processing the request. It's the "answer" part of the conversation

 component: statusCode, Headers and Body

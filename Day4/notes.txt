 1. Creating a Server with Express.js
Concept: Express.js is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for 
Node.js. It simplifies the process of creating web servers and handling 
HTTP requests and responses.

npm i express 
 const express = require('express');
 const app = express();
 const port = 3000; 
 app.get('/', (req, res) => {
 res.send('Hello, World!'); 
 });
 app.listen(port, () => {
 console.log(`Server is running on <http://localhost
 >:${port}`);
 });


2. Wildcard Routes
 Concept: Wildcard routes are used to catch any URL that doesn't match 
any defined route. They are often used to handle (404 Not Found) errors.
 Syntax: Use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard.
code: 
 app.get("*", (req, res) => {
    res.send("404 Not Found");
 })



 3. API development and testing using POSTMAN

 What is Postman?
 ->Postman is a tool used by developers to send test requests to APIs.
 Why use it:
 ->You can send different types of requests GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
 ->You can add data to these requests (query params and request body).
 ->It shows you the response from your API.
 ->Postman is like a "testing friend" for your backend.



Difference Between req.query and req.body 
req.query : Data is in the URL, visible in the address bar, and generally used 
for filters or non sensitive data

req.body : Data is in the request body, not visible, and usually used when 
sending more complex data, or sensitive data.
     it requires app.use(express.json()) middleware otherwise it will give undefined value

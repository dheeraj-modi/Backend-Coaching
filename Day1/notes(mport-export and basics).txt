1. Internet and Its Working

Internet: A global network that connects computers and servers to exchange data.

How It Works:

->Client: Sends a request (e.g., browser searching on Google).
->Server: Processes the request and sends back a response.
->Data Transmission: Follows TCP/IP protocols over networks.

2. Client and Server

client: the one who sends the request for data or services.
server : the computer which is programmed to send the response of client's request

3. Node JS :

Features of Node.js:
->Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Handles multiple requests without waiting for any process to finish.
->Single-Threaded Architecture: Uses a single thread to handle multiple requests efficiently via non-blocking I/O.
->Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
Scalability: Handles thousands of concurrent connections.

4. npm 
->A tool for managing packages and dependencies in Node.js applications.
->Comes installed by default with Node.js.

5. modules and packages

Modules: Reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task or function.
  Purpose: Organize code into smaller, manageable pieces.
 Types:
  Core Modules: Built-in Node.js modules (e.g., fs, http, path).
  Custom Modules: User-defined modules.
  Third-Party Modules: Modules installed via npm.

Packages: A collection of modules bundled together to provide specific functionality.
 Purpose: Simplify tasks by providing ready-to-use tools and libraries.
 Managed using npm (Node Package Manager).

6. import and export
